# CLAUDE.md - Critical Project Requirements

## 🎯 **100% ACCURACY REQUIREMENT** 
**This is the MOST CRITICAL item in our project.**

- ALL numerical analysis must be verified and double-checked
- NO assumptions or estimates without explicit validation  
- ALWAYS cross-reference calculations with source data
- When comparing trends, verify direction (increase/decrease) with actual numbers
- If uncertain about any calculation, STOP and re-verify before proceeding

## 📋 **CONTEXT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
**UPDATE THIS SECTION EVERY TIME YOU WORK ON THE PROJECT**

### Current Session Context (2025-11-27):
- **✅ COMPLETED**: PostgreSQL database architecture implementation
- **✅ DELIVERED**: Production-ready setup scripts with one-command deployment
- **✅ CREATED**: Complete data migration pipeline with 100% accuracy validation  
- **✅ STATUS**: Database system ready for advanced analytics API implementation
- **🎯 NEXT**: API layer development and real-time analytics dashboard integration

### Previous Session Summary:
- Completed accurate month-by-month Sub Order Type analysis (June-Nov 2025)
- Identified seasonal trends: AC dining peaks in hot months, Non AC stable year-round  
- Corrected analytical errors in trend direction (accuracy critical)
- Established need for database-driven analytics for complex queries

### Context Files:
- `context/current_architecture.md` - Current system architecture and database design
- `context/session_notes/` - Detailed notes from each working session
- `context/technical_decisions.md` - Key technical decisions and rationale

## Data Analysis Standards
- Revenue calculations must match source CSV totals exactly
- Trend analysis requires month-by-month breakdown for precision
- All percentage calculations must be verified against raw counts
- Comparative analysis must show both raw numbers and verified direction of change

## Project Context
- Restaurant menu engineering and price optimization platform
- Processing transaction data with verified menu prices only
- Multi-file CSV processing across different time periods
- Focus on actionable business insights with statistical validation

## Current Data Sources
- `data/SepToNov.csv` - September to November 2025 transactions (9,514 orders)
- `data/juneToAug.csv` - June to August 2025 transactions (9,902 orders)  
- `menu_data/` - Verified menu pricing information
- `output/` - Timestamped analysis results

**Remember: Accuracy over speed. Verify every number.**
